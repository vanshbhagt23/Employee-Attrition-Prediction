# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Objective - Using machine learning to predict employee attrition in Python

**Data Description** The dataset consists of 903 rows and 15 columns. Each row in dataset represents an employee; each column contains employee attributes:

#name

#phone numbers

#location

#Emp group

#Function

#Tenure

#Tenure Group

#Expereince

#Martial status

#Age

#Hiring sources

#Promoted/Non promoted

#Job role match

#Stay/left

**APPROACH** The suggested study employs different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic regression, KNN, Decision tree, Naive bayes and data preprocessing processes to improve employee attrition prediction.
